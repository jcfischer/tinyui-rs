A tiny native windowing and GUI library for rust. Currently supports MacOS with other platforms in the future.

Supports common controls like buttons and labels, and webkit (soon opengl) controls, natively, with absolute minimal dependencies. The library usage is loosely based on ggez.

NOTE: This code is not ready for use yet. It can create basic things but the API changes frequently.
